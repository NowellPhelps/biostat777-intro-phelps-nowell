# Introduction
A recent paper showed published in the Lancet [@strain2024national] showed that the prevalence of insufficient physical inactivity has been rising in most regions across the globe. Figure 1 below, taken from this paper, shows this near-universal rise. Furthermore, physical activity has been shown to be a stronger predictor of mortality than age [@leroux2024nhanes]. In order to curb and reverse the increasing trends in physical inactivity, and to target interventions for increasing physical activity, it is important to understand variations in physical activity across different population subgroups.

::: {.callout-note}
Insufficient physical activity is typically defined as not doing 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination per week [@strain2024national].

# Aims
In this analysis I will attempt to characterise differences in phyiscal activity across different population subgroups using NHANES 2011-2012 and NHANES 2013-2014 cohorts, taken from [@Crainiceanu_Goldsmith_Leroux_Cui_2023_website]. These differences could of interest to public health practitioners interested in identifying population subgroups with low rates of physical activity, as these subgroups are those worth considering for targeted behavioural interventions.

# Monitor-Independent Movement Summary (MIMS).

In the dataset used in this analysis, physical activity is measured by Monitor-Independent Movement Summary (MIMS). This is a measure which compresses acceleration measured by a wrist-worn monitor on the X, Y, and Z axes  into a single number, which is standardized across different devices.

# Results and discussion
This purely descriptive data analysis found that there are some differences in the patterns of objective (measured) physical activity as found in a cohort in the united states. In particular, we see that men are slightly less physically active than women, especially in older age groups (Figures 5 and Figure 6), although there was also slightly more variability in men compared to women (Figure 4) and overall the trends are very similar across age group and gender (Figure 2). Interestingly, there are some temporal patterns in the differences between men and women (or boys and girls), where for most age groups, men are more physically active at night than women, but women are more physically active during the day (Figure 7). The exception is for children and adolescents, where boys are more physically active than girls during the day. 

We also see strong temporal patterns in physical activity, as we would naturally expect (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5). We also see decreasing physical activity across age, consistently even when limited to different times of day (Figure 6).

These all together indicate that there might be some differences between men and women worth investigating, but these, and age, do not explain most of the variation of the data, and it is worth further exploration of what the drivers of this are in order to effectively identify subgroups for targeted interventions.

# Note for TAs
I used the functions `select`, `pivot_longer`, `mutate`, `group_by`, `distinct`, and `summarise` from dplyr and tidyr. I used fucntions `geom_line`, `geom_violin` and `geom_point`.
